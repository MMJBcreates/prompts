You are tasked with creating a diagnostic checklist for identifying AI implementation opportunities in a company. This checklist will be used to guide discovery conversations and spot areas where AI can potentially improve operations and efficiency.

You will be provided with two input variables:

{{SIZE}} = 

This variable represents the size of the company (e.g., small, medium, large).

{{INDUSTRY}} = 

This variable represents the industry sector the company operates in.

Using these inputs, create a comprehensive diagnostic checklist tailored to the specific size and industry of the company. Follow these steps:

1. Consider the typical operational structure and challenges faced by a {{SIZE}} company in the {{INDUSTRY}} sector

2. Create a checklist that covers the following areas:

   - Common operational bottlenecks

   - Resource-intensive processes

   - Manual, repetitive tasks

   - Communication inefficiencies

   - Data management challenges

   - Decision-making delays

3. For each area, develop 3-5 specific, relevant questions or checkpoints that can help identify potential AI implementation opportunities.

4. Ensure that each question or checkpoint is:

   - Clear and concise

   - Specific to the {{SIZE}} and {{INDUSTRY}}

   - Actionable and easy to assess

   - Focused on areas where AI could potentially provide solutions

5. Format your checklist in a structured, easy-to-read manner. Use bullet points or numbered lists for each section

6. Begin each section with a brief explanation of why this area is important for AI implementation opportunities.

7. After each question or checkpoint, include a brief note (in parentheses) suggesting how AI might address the identified issue.

Present your final diagnostic checklist within <checklist> tags. Ensure that the checklist is comprehensive, well-organized, and tailored to the specific {{SIZE}} and {{INDUSTRY}} provided.
